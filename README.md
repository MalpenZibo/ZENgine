## What is ZENgine?

ZENgine is a WIP 2D game engine with some very basic features. It's based on an [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architecture and developed using a data-driven and data-oriented design.

The engine uses the OpenGL API and the SDL2 Library. It can run both on Windows and macOS. 

## Motivation
I always been a game engine enthusiast but sadly is not my primary focus in my working life.
I created some experimental game engines for android, one using Java and the other using C++, and some engine for the web using the Canvas API and later the WebGL API.

In the last year, I discovered RUST and now it's my favorite language (sadly in my everyday work it's not used :disappointed_relieved:). So to learn RUST I decided, as a personal project, that writes a game engine from scratch could be a great idea (spoiler, it's not).

At the same time to improve my communication skill I created a youtube series where I try to explain the whole developing process.

## Youtube Series
The making of ZENgine is shown through a series of youtube videos (sorry only in Italian :smirk:)
