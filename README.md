# ZENgine &emsp; ![CI](https://github.com/MalpenZibo/ZENgine/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## What is ZENgine?

ZENgine is a very simple 2D data-driven game engine for didactic purposes written in Rust using an an ECS architecture.

## Inspiration
ZENgine is heavily inspired by:
* [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) A refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust 
* [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) Data-oriented and data-driven game engine written in Rust 
* [kudo](https://github.com/kettle11/kudo) An Entity Component System for Rust.

## Didactic purpose
I started this project mainly to improve my knowledge in Rust, which is a programming language that I love, and in game engine architecture which is a subject that has always fascinated me.

I created a small series of videos (only in Italian üòè) that cover the first iteration of the engine before the massive refactor of all engine.
In the future, I plan to create a series of posts about the engine and how it works.

## Get Started
There's a very crude implementation of `pong` in the example folder that "should" run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and every modern browser.

Simply run `cargo run` in the  `pong` folder or `trunk serve` to run the web version (could be necessary to click on the browser page to make the input system work).

To launch the web version is mandatory to setup correctly the environment.
Install the wasm32-unknown-unknown target with:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Then install `wasm-bindgen-cli` and [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) with:
```bash
cargo install trunk wasm-bindgen-cli
```
